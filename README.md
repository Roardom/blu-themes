# UNIT3D Stylesheets

These stylesheets are meant to be used with the latest UNIT3D release.

There are two options: external, and standalone. Make sure to fill in the correct one in your profile settings.

The external stylesheets are designed for the light theme to be selected as the "base stylesheet", but others can also be used.
